# Retail
A retail empire must plan new store openings over the next 12-18 months and has numerous sites in which the
stores can be opened. It wants to know where the ideal places to open new stores are in terms of market size and
prospective revenue. Relevant data on location, demographic, sales, and revenues of important products for
previously opened stores were provided for analysis and model creation.
Solution- Created a Random Forest and Logistic regression model to predict whether or not a store should be
opened in that specific area. Random Forest proved to be a better model, and 23 additional shop locations were
chosen based on this analysis.
